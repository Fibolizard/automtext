# What is AutomText?
AutomText intends to be an easy-to-use big data tool, aimed to domestic tasks and run-of-the-mill purposes in your computer; it serves as a way to retrieve information from your computer easily, so you'll get maximum eficiency at searching for information in your PC.
#
# That's nice but... What are its actual functions?
#
We based the idea of AutomText off the command prompt command 'find'. If you know a little bit about it, you know that this command can return your coincidental strings from various sorts of files around your PC if you entry a keyword. We expect to not only automate this task, but also to improve it to the maximum efficiency. Along with this function, we expect to complement this function to customizable approaches so the user can get the information they require.

# Ok but... Why would i need such thing?
Lots of people have issues concerning the search of information in their own computer. Let's suppose you have gigabytes worth of TXT files, DOC files, PDF files, and so on, and you intend to look for information within those files; either you need to look for quotes, or you reminded something you don't know where it was, etc. You could always search for every single file you have in your PC, or if you are well versed with Windows commands, probably you can use the aforementioned find command. But for the sake of make your life easier regarding those issues, we expect AutomText to be the solution for that.
